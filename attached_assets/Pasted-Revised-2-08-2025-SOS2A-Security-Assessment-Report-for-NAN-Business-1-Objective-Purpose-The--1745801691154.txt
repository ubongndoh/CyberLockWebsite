SOS2A Security Assessment Report for NAN Business

1. Objective & Purpose
The Small and Medium-Sized Business Organizational and System Security Analysis (SOS2A) assessment evaluates the cybersecurity risks, vulnerabilities, compliance gaps, and security posture of businesses. This report provides quantitative and qualitative insights, focusing on risk mitigation strategies tailored to industry-specific needs.

2. Scope
This assessment covers:
Mode of Operation & Security Risks
Cybersecurity Risk Management
Compliance & Regulatory Requirements
Security Threats & Mitigation Strategies
Security Scorecard Analysis
Recommendations for Strengthening Security Posture

3. Mode of Operations & Security Risks
Business Infrastructure & Risks
Internet Presence Risks: Phishing, Spoofing, Social Engineering.
Potential Security Risks: Weak authentication, misconfigured cloud storage, API vulnerabilities.
Potential Vulnerabilities: Outdated software, exposed RDP ports, lack of MFA.
Mitigation Strategies:
âœ… Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to secure all user accounts.
âœ… Regular security updates and vulnerability patching.
âœ… Deploy Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Endpoint Security solutions.
âœ… Conduct employee security awareness training to reduce phishing risks.

4. Cybersecurity Risk Management
A structured cybersecurity risk management approach is essential to protect the business from cyber threats.
Risk Management Process:
Identify Risks â†’ Conduct continuous security audits and vulnerability scans.
Assess Impact â†’ Prioritize threats based on business-critical functions.
Mitigate â†’ Implement technical and administrative security controls.
Monitor & Improve â†’ Utilize SOC monitoring and real-time threat detection.
Key Risk Reduction Techniques:
ðŸ”¹ Implement Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) for network security.
ðŸ”¹ Adopt Security Operations Center (SOC) monitoring for threat detection.
ðŸ”¹ Use Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) for advanced endpoint security.
ðŸ”¹ Regularly train employees on security best practices to prevent human errors.

5. Compliance & Regulatory Requirements
Compliance Framework Mapping
Framework
Compliance Status
CMMC v2.0
Partial compliance, requires access control improvements.
MITRE ATT&CK
Used for threat modeling, but needs implementation in risk assessments.
NIST CSF
Aligns with best practices, but requires ongoing policy enhancements.
SOC 2
Basic compliance, but needs stronger data governance.
UK NCSC Cyber Essentials
Needs improved endpoint and browser security measures.

Key Compliance Gaps & Recommendations:
âœ… Strengthen data security to meet PCI-DSS and CMMC standards.
âœ… Implement NIST CSF-aligned policies for risk management.
âœ… Conduct internal audits to improve SOC 2 and CMMC compliance.

8. Tailored Recommendations
Immediate Quick Wins (0-3 months)
âœ… Enable MFA across all accounts.
âœ… Deploy advanced endpoint security solutions.
âœ… Conduct employee security awareness training.
âœ… Patch all software vulnerabilities and disable unused ports.
Strategic Goals (3-12 months)
ðŸ”¹ Establish a Security Operations Center (SOC) for continuous monitoring.
ðŸ”¹ Enhance regulatory compliance with CMMC & PCI-DSS frameworks.
ðŸ”¹ Implement Zero Trust security measures to reduce unauthorized access risks.
ðŸ”¹ Deploy cloud security posture management (CSPM) tools to monitor cloud risks.
Return on Investment (ROI) & Cost-Effectiveness
âœ” MFA implementation: Low cost, reduces account compromise by 99%.
âœ” SIEM/EDR integration: Higher cost, but 40% faster response time to incidents.
âœ” Security Awareness Training: Cuts phishing risks by 80%.

9. Conclusion & Next Steps
By adopting the recommended security measures, businesses can:
âœ… Reduce cyber risks by up to 40%.
âœ… Achieve compliance with industry security standards.
âœ… Improve incident response times and prevent costly security breaches.
Next Steps for SMBs:
ðŸ“Œ Conduct a SOC2 security audit.
ðŸ“Œ Enhance cloud security & endpoint protection.
ðŸ“Œ Implement advanced threat detection & response mechanisms.
